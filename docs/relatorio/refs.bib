	abstract = {The Kalman ﬁlter(KF) is one of the most widely used methods for tracking and estimation due to its simplicity, optimality, tractability and robustness. However, the application of the KF to nonlinear systems can be diﬃcult. The most common approach is to use the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) which simply linearises all nonlinear models so that the traditional linear Kalman ﬁlter can be applied. Although the EKF (in its many forms) is a widely used ﬁltering strategy, over thirty years of experience with it has led to a general consensus within the tracking and control community that it is diﬃcult to implement, diﬃcult to tune, and only reliable for systems which are almost linear on the time scale of the update intervals.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel tracking system based on edge-based object proposal and data association called object proposal association. Our object proposal method accurately detects and localizes objects in an image by searching for object-like regions, with the assumption that an object is represented by a closed boundary. To search for closed boundaries in an image, we present a new Edge Fields (EFs) technique. Using this technique, our method can extract high-quality edges and can obtain accurate boundaries from the image. The EFs technique consists of blurring and thresholding steps, where the former helps extract high-quality edges and the latter prevents the method from losing image details while blurring. After the method extracts object-like regions, we associate the regions in the previous frame with those in the current frame. For this purpose, using the Markov chain Monte Carlo data association (MCMCDA) algorithm, we can ﬁnd pairs of similar regions across two frames. Experimental results demonstrate that our object proposal method is competitive with state-of-the-art object proposal methods on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset. Our tracking method is also competitive with state-of-the-art tracking methods on Object Tracking Benchmark dataset.},

	abstract = {For 15 years now, visual tracking has been a very active research area of the computer vision community. But an increasing amount of works can be observed in the last ﬁve years. This has led to the development of numerous algorithms that can deal with more and more complex video sequences. Each of them has its own strengths and weaknesses. That is the reason why it becomes necessary to compare those algorithms. For this purpose, some datasets dedicated to visual tracking as well as, sometimes, their ground truth annotation ﬁles are regularly made publicly available by researchers. However, each dataset has its own speciﬁcities and is sometimes dedicated to test the ability of some algorithms to tackle only one or a few speciﬁc visual tracking subproblems. This article provides an overview of some of the datasets that are most used by the visual tracking community, but also of others that address speciﬁc tasks. We also propose a cartography of these datasets from a novel perspective, namely that of the difﬁculties the datasets present for visual tracking.},

	abstract = {In the visual object tracking, the Kalman ﬁlter presents commonly the state model and observation model uncertainty in the actual performance of Gaussian noise, so it makes the estimation of certain parameters produce errors in the model, and results in decreasing estimation precision. In order to enhance the stability of the Kalman ﬁlter, an algorithm based on centroid weighted Kalman ﬁlter (CWKF) for object tracking is proposed in this paper. The algorithm ﬁrstly uses background subtraction method to detect moving target region, and then uses the Kalman ﬁlter to predict target position, combining centroid weighted method to optimize the predictive state value, ﬁnally updates observation data according to the corrected state value. Tracking experiments show that the algorithm can detect effectively moving objects and at the same time it can quickly and accurately track moving objects with good robustness.},

The approach involves a mixture of stable image structure, learned over long time courses, along with 2-frame motion information and an outlier process. An online EM-algorithm is used to adapt the appearance model parameters over time. An implementation of this approach is developed for an appearance model based on the ﬁlter responses from a steerable pyramid. This model is used in a motion-based tracking algorithm to provide robustness in the face of image outliers, such as those caused by occlusions. It is also provides the ability to adapt to natural changes in appearance, such as those due to facial expressions or variations in 3D pose. We show experimental results on a variety of natural image sequences of people moving within cluttered environments.},
